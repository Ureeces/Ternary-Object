// create a variable speedMessage that has a value resulting from a ternary
// if the speed equals 70 it should say '70 is the perfect speed'
// if the speed is greater than or equal to 90 it should say 'Are you trying to get us killed'
// if the speed is less than 50 it should have the value 'Faster please'
// if speed is less than 10 it should say you should not drive
// create a variable allowableSpeed that sets a speed based on the range of numbers that are left. so...if allowableSpeed is set to a number in that range your default output should be `<speed> is a decent speed`
